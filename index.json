Property (T) translates in these cases to vanishing of the first cohomology with unitary coefficients.

We define an infinite family of finite groups for which the Laitinen Conjecture remained unsettled and show that this conjecture holds for this family of groups. Moreover, in the case of the groups from the family, the Laitinen Conjecture implies the existence of their actions on homotopy spheres with exactly two fixed points and non-isomorphic group module structures of the tangent spaces at the two fixed points.","tags":[],"title":"New results on one and two fixed point actions on spheres","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1606320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606320000,"objectID":"840867c2da6d358c55917de6296ddb2d","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/on-exotic-group-actions-on-spheres/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/on-exotic-group-actions-on-spheres/","section":"event","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"On exotic group actions on spheres","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A course conducted for Cumputer Science undegraduate students of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.

The conjecture predicts an answer to the Smith question which reads as follows. Is it true that for a finite group G acting smoothly on a sphere with exactly two fixed points, the tangent spaces at the fixed points have always isomorphic module structures defined by differentiation of the action? Using the technique of induction of group representations, we indicate a new (for the first time, infinite) family of finite Oliver groups for which the Laitinen Conjecture holds.","tags":null,"title":"A new family of finite Oliver groups satisfying the Laitinen Conjecture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacek Mizerka","Agnieszka Stróżyńska-Szajek","Piotr Mizerka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"4205fc8e377927adb2500213498b1426","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/bitcoin/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bitcoin/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper joins discussions about Bitcoin's relationship to investments in developed and emerging markets. Our study contributes to the ongoing discussion of the role of Bitcoin for investors. In our research, we analyse relationships on financial markets with Bitcoin user graph characteristics. We examine the relationships between Bitcoin rates of return, stock indices, and variables characterising Bitcoin users who carried out the largest number of Bitcoin buy and sell transactions and users who carried out transactions with the highest amounts. We mainly focus on the problem whether the Bitcoin rate of return is mostly driven by capital market situation or major Bitcoin users behaviour. Our results confirmed that there is not, in general, significant relationship between financial market situation (if such relationship does exist, it is found in emerging markets). However, our findings indicate a significant impact of the behaviour of major Bitcoin users on Bitcoin rate of return.","tags":null,"title":"The role of Bitcoin on developed and emerging markets – on the basis of a Bitcoin users graph analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A course conducted for Mathematics undegraduate students of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.\n","date":1569924000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569924000,"objectID":"2604bf76d32c802b0030d7317de4346f","permalink":"https://example.com/teaching/algebra_number_theory_2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/algebra_number_theory_2019/","section":"teaching","summary":"winter semester 2019/2020","tags":null,"title":"Introduction to algebra and number theory","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A course conducted for the first year Mathematics undegraduate students of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.
